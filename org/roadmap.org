* Introduction

This describes the roadmap for future features in tawny.


* v1.1

** Features

*** tawny-mode.el, port to cider

tawny-mode.el currently depends on nrepl.el which is now deprecated in terms
of cider, which contains nrepl-client.el. Mostly, this should be a name
change, but things will have changed somewhat by the time we get there.

*** Explanation

Tawny needs to uncover explanation code. Currently, most people use this
through protege, but as code can be quite slow, it would be good to have this
working in concert with testing, so that consistency test errors automate
explanation.

* Beyond

** Features

*** Better support for querying

Currently, querying ontologies is painful and requires recourse to the OWL
API. tawny.query allows some of this, but only returns a map. Need some
predicates and extractor functions for common calls.
