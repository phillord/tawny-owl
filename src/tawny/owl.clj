  "Takes an existing definition, adds it to the current ontology, and then
adds more frames. owlentity is the OWLEntity to be refined, and frames are the
additional frames. The keys to the frames must be appropriate for the type of
entity. See 'owl-class' or 'object-property' for more details.

This is useful for two main reasons. First, to build class definitions in two
places and add frames in both of these places. For simple forward declaration
'declare-classes' is better. The second is where the same class needs to
appear in two ontologies, but with more axioms in the second. This can enable,
for example, building two interlocking ontologies with different OWL profiles.
