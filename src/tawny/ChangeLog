2013-05-20  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* reasoner.clj: Changed *reasoner-progress-monitor* to use an
	atom. This is more convienient in some ways, but represents a
	significant breaking change.

2013-04-22  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/tawny/owl.clj: Added full support for individual frames.
	The :types keyword was made singular at the same time to ensure
	consistency.


2013-02-03  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/tawny/repl.clj: New functions for repl interaction. Now
	hooks into native clojure.repl/doc function so that ontology
	entities can be looked up.

	* src/tawny/read.clj: Cleaned up code, and add utility filters and
	transform functions.

	* project.clj: Updated to OWL API 3.4.3.

	* src/tawny/owl.clj: Added support for options and covering axioms
	in as-subclasses macro. Added new predicates disjoint? equivalent?
	Support for RDF output.

2013-01-21  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/tawny/owl.clj: Ontologies are now representing purely with a
	OWL API object without additional baggage. This simplifies the
	code and should also improve interaction at the REPL.

2013-01-16  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/tawny/owl.clj: with-probe-entities -- a useful macro for testing.

2013-01-15  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/tawny/reasoner.clj: Added isubclass? isuperclass? predicates

2013-01-14  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/tawny/memorise.clj: Initial implementation of library for
	remembering symbols generated from OWL files.

	* src/tawny/polyglot.clj: Initial implementation of library for 
	multi-lingual support.


2012-12-10  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/owl/owl.clj: Improved the implementation of remove-entity to
	use the OWL API directly. This should also improve the apperance
	of classes in repl.

2012-12-07  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* project.clj: 0.3 update with first 1.3.6.1

2012-11-24  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/owl/import.clj: Import mechanism added, reading an OWL file
	(or stream, url or so on), and pulling all items into the current
	namespace, so that they can be refered to by other clojure-owl
	files. Functions can be supplied to filter the file for desired
	entities and to transform the files into valid lisp symbols. 

2012-11-18  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/owl/render.clj: Start of a framework for pretty printing
	of OWL entities

2012-11-13  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/owl/owl.clj: Default ontology is now bound into the
	namespace. Modifiying ontologies in two namespaces now works as
	expected rather than adding which ever defontology was evaled
	last.


2012-11-16  Phillip Lord  <phillip.lord@newcastle.ac.uk>

	* src/owl/owl.clj: Now handles prefixes for all the ontologies
	that have been loaded.
