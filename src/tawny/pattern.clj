;; * Intering Macro Support

;; Writing functions is relatively straight-forward, but writing macros is a bit
;; more of a pain. So, here we add generic support for turning a function
;; defining a pattern into a macro. To do this, we essentially need three things.

;;  - the pattern needs to return OWL entities and a string to intern.
;;  - for macros the "ontology as the first argument" paradigm doesn't work, so
;;    we need support for adding an ontology frame and extracting it again.
;;  - something to actually do the interning.

;; To support the first, we introduce the ~Named~ record to package an entity
;; with the name to refer to it; the ~p~ function introduced later actually uses
;; these. The ~pattern-generator~ and ~extract-ontology-arg~ functions support
;; the latter. And ~intern-owl-entities~ supports the last.

;; Examples of these in use will be seen later.

;; #+begin_src clojure

    Named
  tawny.protocol/Entityable (as-entity [this] (:entity this)))

  "Given a list of vectors of form [name entity], as returned by the p
  function, intern all the entities in the current namespace."

        ontology (second a)]
    {:ontology ontology
     :args
     (concat b (drop 2 a))}))

removed and placed as the first arg, which is passed to the pattern-function,

;; * Easy Pattern Creation with "P"

;; The frame syntax of tawny makes it easy to type but harder to parse.
;; Generally, ~tawny.owl~ can take care of this, but there is a problem where
;; parts of the pattern are optional. For example, consider:

;; #+begin_example
;; (owl-class "newclass" :super s)
;; #+end_example

;; This is a pattern because we use the free variable ~s~. The problem comes if
;; ~s~ is ~nil~, which tawny treats as an error (for good reasons!).
;; Unfortunately, we cannot just strip nil values because we might have this:

;; #+begin_example
;; (owl-class "newclass" :super s :equivalent e)
;; #+end_example

;; If ~s~ is nil and we nil-strip arguments, then we end up with
;; ~:super :equivalent~ as a sequence, which tawny also treats as an error (for
;; good reasons!). So, provide ~p~ which nil-strip and removes frames with
;; nothing but nils. So:

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (p owl-class "newclass" :super nil :equivalent e)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; now works because both ~:super~ and ~nil~ are removed. Other uses such as:

;; #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; (p owl-class "newclass" :super nil c :equivalent e)
;; #+END_EXAMPLE

;; are also fine. Of course, this puts the onus on the calling function to ensure
;; that only values which are meant to be optional are passed and are not nil.

;; ~p~ also modifies the return type. It extracts the first argument
;; (~"newclass"~ in the examples) and returns a ~Named~ entity for use with the
;; interning support.

;; #+begin_src clojure
(defn- nil-strip

;; * Pattern Annotation

;; It is often useful to be able to group all of the entities created as a the
;; result of an instantiation of a pattern, so that it is possible to retrieve
;; all these entities. This section provides this capability.

;; The implementation has one important consequence; I have chosen to use
;; annotation properties, rather than representing this knowledge Clojure side
;; which would have been perfectly possible. This means that the use of patterns
;; are represented explicitly in the final ontology, as an annotation between the
;; class and the object property. This obviously has consequences for the final
;; serialized form of the ontology which may or may not be a good thing. On
;; balance, I think, representing the knowledge externally is positive, and not
;; having to store extra global state is definately good.

;; * Facets

;; This is our first example of a pattern. Many ontologies define entities by a
;; set of properties with particular values, rather like a childhood card game;
;; cars have speed, engine size, number of people and so on; planes have wing
;; span, passangers and altitude.

;; Here, we add support for these that we call *facets*; where a set of classes
;; are used as values for a specific property. The relationship between the class
;; and the propety is stored as a annotation, using the ~as-facet~ function,
;; while the ~facet~ function returns one or more existential restrictions using
;; the appropriate property (of which there may be several). This means that
;; multiple facets can be expressed rapidly just by using their values.

  and a class, indicating that the class is a value in a particular facet
